  1. **Subject:** Main objects/figures, appearance, features, species (if applicable), clothing, pose, actions. Be extremely specific (e.g., "a fluffy ginger cat with emerald green eyes sitting on a windowsill" instead of "a cat").
  2. **Composition:** Arrangement of subjects (centered, off-center, foreground, background), perspective/camera angle (close-up, wide shot, bird's-eye view).
  3. **Setting:** Environment, location, time of day, weather. Be specific (e.g., "a dimly lit, ornate library with towering bookshelves" instead of "a library").
  4. **Style:** Artistic style (photorealistic, oil painting, watercolor, cartoon, pixel art, abstract). Mention specific artists if relevant.
  5. **Lighting:** Lighting conditions (bright sunlight, soft indoor lighting, dramatic shadows, backlighting), direction and intensity of light.
  6. **Color Palette:** Dominant colors, overall color scheme (vibrant, muted, monochromatic, warm, cool).
  7. **Texture:** Textures of objects and surfaces (smooth, rough, furry, metallic, glossy).
  8. **Mood/Atmosphere:** Overall feeling or emotion (serene, joyful, mysterious, ominous).

  **Output Format:** I want the prompt to be ONLY a single paragraph of text, directly usable by the text-to-image model. **Do not add any conversational filler, preambles, or extra sentences like "Text-to-Image Prompt:". Do not format the output as a list or use any special characters like <0xC2><0xA0>.**
  **Example Output (Correct Format): "A photorealistic image of a Ragdoll or Birman cat with light cream and beige long fur, sitting upright on a kitchen counter or appliance with its paws tucked beneath it. The cat has bright blue eyes, a small pink nose, and pointed, tufted ears. Its tail is long and fluffy, draping down behind it. The background is slightly blurred and features a dark horizontal band suggesting an appliance, and a glass partition with black metal frames. The lighting is soft and diffused, illuminating the cat evenly. The dominant colors are light cream, beige, white, blue, and black. The overall style is realistic photography with a focus on detail and natural lighting. The image conveys a sense of calmness and gentle curiosity."
  **Important:** The prompt must be highly descriptive, prioritizing the most visually important elements for accurate recreation. The prompt can be up to 75 tokens.`;

  Subject: Marcus, a confident street interviewer in his late 20s, wearing trendy casual clothing
  Context: busy urban street with pedestrians and city life in background, natural street environment
  Action: approaches people with microphone, engaging in spontaneous conversations with genuine curiosity
  Style: documentary street style with natural lighting, authentic urban aesthetic
  Camera: handheld documentary style with dynamic movement, following action naturally
  Composition: medium shots capturing both interviewer and subjects, environmental context
  Ambiance: natural daylight with urban atmosphere, street lighting
  Audio: clear interview audio: 'What's the most interesting thing that happened to you today?' with authentic street ambiance
  Negative prompt: no text overlays, no watermarks, no cartoon effects, no unrealistic proportions, no blurry faces, no distorted hands, no artificial lighting, no oversaturation, no low resolution artifacts, no compression noise, no camera shake, no poor audio quality, no lip-sync issues, no unnatural movements
  Instructions:
  1.Â Maintain the structure of the example prompt, including Subject, Context, Action, Style, Camera, Composition, Ambiance, Audio, and Negative prompt.
  2.Â Vary the scenes and contexts to avoid repetition.
  3.Â Ensure the prompts are suitable for generating realistic and engaging video content with Veo3.
